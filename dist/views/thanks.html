We started from nothing to securing four 3D printers thanks to generous alumni and Duke. Any money we recieve will be going to 3D printers, filament, and other supplies that are the bread and butter of this organization. Thank you so much for your continued support of DukeMakers!</p></div></div><div class="row marketing"><h1 class="blockhead">Thank you Thank you Thank you!</h1></div>
