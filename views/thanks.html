<div class="container"><div class="row marketing"><h1>with love and thanks</h1><p>We would not be able to get very far without the help of very special alumni and faculty. We started from nothing to securing four 3D printers thanks to generous alumni and Duke. Any money we recieve will be going to 3D printers, filament, and other supplies that are the bread and butter of this organization. Thank you so much for your continued support of DukeMakers!</p></div></div><div class="row marketing"><h1 class="blockhead">thank you thank you thank you!</h1></div><script>Path.listen();</script>
