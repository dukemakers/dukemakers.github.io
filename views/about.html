<div class="container"><div class="row marketing"><h1>our mission</h1><p>DukeMakers is committed to bringing, developing, and incorporating 3D printing best practices and processes on campus wherever it can. We aspire to inspire all generations of Duke students with the next generation of manufacturing and product design. We seek to work with people across Duke's disciplines (Mathematics, Engineering, Biology/Medical, and Visual Arts) to bring a better living and working experience to Duke's campus, to improve the lives of faculty, staff, and students, and to raise Duke's capability to reach and touch people's lives worldwide. DukeMakers is a student organization on campus that combines all enthusiasts, associated entrepreneurs, and interested students under one umbrella to give them both a voice and a means to advance the progress of 3D printing on campus.</p></div></div><div class="row marketing"><h1 class="blockhead">where do you fall, maybe all?</h1><div class="col-sm-4"><h1>Designer</h1><p>You could be an artist, you could be an engineer. Either way you're a creative fellow who wants to see the ideas in their head become a reality. You see printable objects in your sleep. You look at the missing key on your keyboard and know it can be printed... scratch that you have bigger and better plans. As a designer, you always have another 'good' idea, and you want it to materialize now.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><h1>Experimenter</h1><p>You know that 3D printing is not perfect. Sometimes 3D prints feel too much like shale. Sometimes they are not accurate. You also know that the world of 3D printing isn't limited to plastics. Why not print in metal like steel and gold? And why stop at metals? Why not print biological cells and make tissue? Of course, all of this is experimental. As an experimenter, you want to see how far you can take 3D printing. You love working with hardware and getting your hands dirty.</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><h1>Outreacher</h1><p>You find this 3D printing thing too amazing to contain it within youself. Conversations with your friends, family, strangers? Always 3D printing. You see the potential 3D printing has to change the world and you want to take the time to deliver it to others that don't know of its power. As an outreacher, you will be talking with artists, scientists, companies, whoever will listen, writing run-on sentences, about 3D printing and its awesomeness.</p></div></div><script>Path.listen();</script>
